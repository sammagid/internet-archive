This action is part of a broader reorganization aimed at reducing what administration officials have described as a ""bloated bureaucracy."" The total reduction, when accounting for voluntary retirements and resignations, is expected to reach nearly **3,000 positions**[1][2][3].

The layoffs target ""non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable efficiencies may be found from centralization or consolidation of functions and responsibilities,"" according to an official department communication[1]. Impacted employees began receiving notice on Friday, with resources set up at the department's Washington headquarters to assist outgoing staff in the termination process[1][2].

These moves follow months of uncertainty for State Department personnel, who had been awaiting clarity amid discussions of staff reductions and organizational restructuring[2]. The cuts were scaled down from earlier projections, which had anticipated as many as 2,000 layoffs, but still mark one of the largest reductions-in-force at the department in recent history[1][3].","['https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/07/state-department-lays-1350-employees/406665/', 'https://www.aol.com/u-diplomats-brace-layoffs-months-231210192.html', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-trump-administration-start-layoffs-in-coming-days/']"

On July 10, 2025, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), along with other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel, executed warrants at marijuana facilities in the Camarillo area, north of Los Angeles[1][5][2]. The confrontation was marked by the use of crowd control measures, including the deployment of smoke or tear gas canisters to disperse protesters who had gathered to oppose the raid[1][2].

The scene grew chaotic as protesters blocked roads and, according to some reports, federal agents drove vehicles through fields. Witnesses and advocacy group representatives described federal agents—sometimes masked and armed with rifles—using irritants like tear gas and rubber bullets on community members in what was characterized as an unusual level of force for a remote agricultural area[3][5]. Multiple ambulances arrived at the scene, though it remains unclear if anyone was seriously injured[3].

California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the enforcement actions, stating that such immigration raids have a real cost on hardworking families and communities and criticizing the use of tactics he deemed inhumane and fear-inducing[1]. The DHS defended its actions, asserting that its agents were acting lawfully in serving a warrant at a marijuana facility[1][5]. 

The raid reflects ongoing tensions over immigration enforcement and federal raids in Southern California, with recent weeks seeing increased activity at swap meets, car washes, bus stops, and churches in the region[4].","['https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-agents-clash-protesters-ice-raid-southern-california/story?id=123657572', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw1xdUoQWXY', 'https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-10/federal-immigration-sweep-ventura-county-farms', 'https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/la-immigration-raids-lawsuit/', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/camarillo-farm-border-patrol-immigration/']"

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are touring some of the hardest-hit areas, meeting with local officials, first responders, and families affected by the disaster[1][5].

The reference to Trump ""avoiding criticism he's heaped on other governors"" highlights a contrast in his public rhetoric: while he has previously criticized governors of other states, particularly during disasters like the California wildfires, he has refrained from such criticism regarding Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s handling of this crisis[3][4]. Instead, Trump has focused on the ""once-in-every-200-year"" nature of the event and has praised the ongoing federal and local response[2][5]. He told reporters he delayed his visit initially to avoid burdening authorities while search and rescue operations were still underway[2][5].

The visit also comes amid scrutiny of the administration’s longstanding aim to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and shift disaster response more to states, a policy Trump has promoted but not repeated since the flooding[2][5]. FEMA’s response and recent staffing reductions, as well as new spending approval rules, have drawn criticism that the federal response might have been slowed[5]. Despite this, Trump, during his visit, is emphasizing support for affected communities rather than reigniting debates over FEMA’s future or criticizing the state’s handling of the emergency[2][5].","['https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-texas-flood-damage-search-for-missing-continues/', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-plans-tour-texas-flood-damage-scope-disaster-123666823', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-heads-texas-after-catastrophic-flooding-avoiding-criticism/story?id=123650032', 'https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donaldtrump', 'https://san.com/cc/trump-first-lady-to-tour-flood-damage-in-kerrville-texas/']"

Trump communicated this in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, specifically citing concerns over Canadian trade barriers in sectors like dairy, arguing that these practices harm U.S. farmers and pose a threat to national security[1][3]. The tariff is described as ""blanket,"" applying to all Canadian goods entering the U.S., and will be added on top of any existing sector-specific duties[1][3][4].

Trump's decision marks a **significant escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada**, one of America’s largest trading partners[2][3]. The move follows a period of fluctuating trade policies and ongoing negotiations, with the Trump administration sending similar letters to multiple world leaders, outlining tariff rates to take effect unless new trade deals are reached by August 1[2][5]. Prime Minister Carney has stated that Canada will continue to defend its workers and businesses in the face of these developments[2].

Rubio and Wang met in Kuala Lumpur during the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Forum, with both sides aiming to bolster their standing among Asian nations at a moment when the US announced **steep tariffs on several Asian countries and US allies**. The new US tariffs include rates such as **25 percent on Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia; 32 percent for Indonesia; 36 percent for Thailand and Cambodia; and 40 percent on Myanmar and Laos**. These measures have drawn sharp warnings from Beijing, which has threatened to retaliate not only against the US but also against nations cooperating with the US to shift supply chains away from China[1].

Rubio's visit is part of a broader effort to signal renewed US interest in the Indo-Pacific region, emphasizing that the US remains a preferable partner compared to China, particularly as trade disputes escalate. His meetings with leaders from Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia are part of this diplomatic push[1].

- Trump stated he will send weapons, including **Patriot air defense systems**, to Ukraine via NATO partners[4][5]. This marks a shift in policy after a brief pause in some weapons shipments to Ukraine earlier in the month[2][3].
- The U.S. is **selling defensive weapons—like Patriot systems—to NATO countries**, which can then supply these systems to Ukraine from their own inventories[1][5]. European allies such as Germany and Norway have already agreed to contribute Patriot systems, and Ukraine has requested as many as ten additional batteries to counter escalating Russian missile and drone attacks[1].
- Trump and his administration have indicated some reluctance to deplete U.S. stockpiles directly and are encouraging European NATO members to send their own Patriot systems, with the U.S. offering financial agreements to replenish their supplies[1][3][5].
- The policy adjustment comes amid renewed and intensified Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine, increasing the urgency for advanced air defense solutions[1].

In summary, the **headline is accurate**: Ukraine is set to receive U.S.-origin Patriot air defense systems, facilitated through NATO allies, as confirmed by both President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy[1][4][5].

This approach is seen as risky for several reasons:

- **Political Risks:** Altering district boundaries to favor one’s own party can invite backlash, particularly in swing districts or among independent voters. It can also provoke lawsuits over gerrymandering, which is a recurring issue whenever Texas or other states attempt significant redistricting[2].
- **Legal and Electoral Uncertainty:** Redistricting efforts often lead to protracted legal battles that can delay or overturn new maps, and the ultimate results may not benefit the party initiating the changes, especially in unpredictable election cycles such as midterms[2].
- **Strategizing for Majority:** The strategy reflects the reality that Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House, and maintaining or expanding it is a top priority. Redrawing maps is seen as a direct way to create more “safe” seats or at least to minimize losses, though such moves are fraught with uncertainty[1][2].

In summary, the headline encapsulates a high-stakes gamble by House Republicans—using redistricting as a core strategy to retain or expand their majority, despite the potential for legal challenges, public scrutiny, and electoral consequences[2].","['https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/16/rnc-live-updates-coverage/the-gops-2025-dream-00168905', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnz0DUlwrjE', 'https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/03/house-passes-gop-megabill-00438206', 'https://www.politico.com/politics', 'https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/10/house-gop-adopts-budget-framework-paving-the-way-for-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-00283511']"

**Key Points Behind the Headline**

- **Tariff as Political Leverage**: Trump has framed the 50% tariff as a measure to seek “justice” for Bolsonaro, who is currently facing legal prosecution in Brazil[1][3].
- **Trigger and Timing**: The decision was reportedly sparked by Trump’s frustration with Brazil’s participation in a gathering of emerging market nations and dissatisfaction with the treatment of Bolsonaro, including alleged censorship and legal proceedings against him[1][3].
- **Rationale and Response**: The White House reportedly concluded that other forms of punitive action (like sanctions) would be too slow or complex, making tariffs the chosen instrument[1][3].
- **Broader Implications**: The move has caused a global diplomatic backlash and deepened the rift between the U.S. and Brazil, as well as drawing criticism for using trade policy as a tool for political intervention[3].

In summary, the headline highlights how Trump’s tariff threat is both a direct response to Bolsonaro’s legal troubles and part of a larger geopolitical dispute, with significant economic and diplomatic consequences[1][3].","['https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/10/trumps-brics-fueled-anger-sparked-50-percent-tariff-threat-on-brazil-00447814', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXMakEbfzKQ', 'https://www.deccanherald.com/world/behind-trumps-decision-to-tax-brazil-to-save-bolsonaro-3626151', 'https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/trumps-brics-fueled-anger-sparked-50-percent-tariff-threat-on-brazil-00447814']"

Initially, there were reports and statements from President Trump and his Homeland Security Secretary indicating that they considered eliminating FEMA. Trump had repeatedly suggested that states should take primary responsibility for disaster response, and this notion was reflected in earlier rhetoric and administrative actions[4][2].

However, as of July 2025, the administration has stepped back from any concrete plans to abolish FEMA. Instead, the new direction is toward a **""rebranding"" of FEMA's role**, emphasizing **greater state leadership** and a more decentralized approach to disaster response. A White House official described this as a structural change that quietly elevated state authority, with the federal agency continuing to support but not lead disaster efforts at the national level[2].

This policy adjustment became particularly significant after severe floods hit Texas, resulting in at least 120 deaths and more than 160 missing. Trump visited the disaster zone and signed a federal disaster declaration, thereby releasing federal aid to Texas. The federal response highlighted the ongoing and crucial role FEMA plays in disaster assistance, even as the administration presses for states to take a larger share of responsibility[2].

Administration officials have clarified that **abolishing the agency is no longer being considered**, although changes to its structure and operations are ongoing. The focus has shifted to making FEMA a ""lean, deployable disaster force"" that supports state agencies, with new leadership and plans for a broader overhaul after the hurricane season concludes[1][4].

This change comes amid both bipartisan and public scrutiny, with many emphasizing FEMA’s role in supporting states during major disasters and questioning the feasibility and wisdom of abolishing such a central federal agency[1][5].","['https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/06/trumps-plan-overhaul-disaster-agency-once-hurricane-season-over-prompts-democratic-concerns/406007/', 'https://economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/trump-administration-scraps-plan-to-abolish-fema-washington-post-reports/articleshow/122386614.cms', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/council-to-assess-the-federal-emergency-management-agency/', 'https://politicalwire.com/2025/07/11/trump-backs-away-from-abolishing-fema/', 'https://azgovernor.gov/office-arizona-governor/news/2025/06/governor-katie-hobbs-calls-trump-administration-end-attacks']"

In interviews and statements confirmed across multiple news outlets, Trump explained that **U.S. arms will be sold to NATO, and then NATO will provide those weapons to Ukraine**, ensuring that NATO countries—rather than the U.S. directly—cover the full cost of the weapons[1][3][4][5].

Trump described the arrangement as follows:

> ""We're sending weapons to NATO, and NATO is paying for those weapons, 100%. So what we're doing is the weapons that are going out are going to NATO, and then NATO is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and NATO is paying for those weapons."" [1][4][5]

**Details of the agreement:**
- The arrangement was reportedly discussed and agreed upon during the NATO summit in The Hague in late June 2025[1][3].
- The types of weapons covered by this deal have not been publicly detailed, but sources indicate the scheme could include not just air defense support but also offensive weaponry[3][5].
- This plan provides a **mechanism for European allies to act as intermediaries** for U.S. weapons, addressing prior restrictions on the resale of U.S. arms and sidestepping a recent pause in direct Pentagon aid to Ukraine[1][5].
- European leaders, including Germany’s Chancellor, have signaled readiness to purchase U.S. arms for Ukraine under this new framework[1].

**Conflicting statements and policy context:**
- While Trump told NBC News the arms would ultimately be for Ukraine, some administration officials have maintained that the U.S. is ""sending defensive weapons to NATO"" and that ""NATO can decide what to do with it,"" which technically keeps the U.S. at arm’s length from directly arming Ukraine[3][5].
- The move reflects a shift in Trump’s stance, as he had previously opposed new U.S. arms packages for Ukraine, partly to avoid deeper involvement in the conflict with Russia[3][5].
- This policy comes after the Pentagon froze a shipment of defensive aid to Ukraine, which Trump said he did not approve, and subsequently allowed such defensive arms shipments to resume[1][3][5].

**Diplomatic signals:**
- The deal was apparently prompted in part by a direct request from Ukraine, seeking new ways to access U.S.-made arms after the Pentagon’s pause on direct support[5].
- European leadership is actively coordinating to ensure Ukraine receives needed military support, with statements from Dutch and German officials backing increased air defense and ammunition transfers[1][5].

In summary, **Trump has confirmed a new arrangement in which U.S. weapons are sold to NATO, with NATO allies paying the full cost and then supplying them to Ukraine**. This allows Ukraine continued access to U.S.-made arms despite recent pauses in direct U.S. military aid and marks a notable evolution in Trump’s approach to the war and U.S.-Ukraine policy[1][3][5].","['https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-reveals-nato-sale-boost-arms-ukraine-putin-launches-overnight-maternity-strike', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTHCf1_6pzk', 'https://www.axios.com/2025/07/11/trump-ukraine-weapons-nato-allies-sell', 'https://www.erienewsnow.com/story/52915663/trump-says-he-struck-deal-to-send-us-weapons-to-ukraine-through-nato', 'https://time.com/7301675/ukraine-us-weapons-nato-military-defense-spending-trump-putin-russia/']"

The anniversary is a powerful and painful reminder for families and the community, not only due to the ongoing search for approximately **1,000 still-missing victims**, but also because efforts to deny or minimize the genocide persist in some quarters. Both the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice have ruled the Srebrenica massacre as genocide, though some leaders in the region continue to resist this recognition[2][3].

The United Nations General Assembly recently adopted a resolution to formally commemorate the Srebrenica genocide annually on July 11, further underscoring its significance as *Europe’s only genocide officially acknowledged by international courts since the Holocaust*[2].","['https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thousands-gather-srebrenica-30th-anniversary-europes-acknowledged-genocide-123669027', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/srebrenica-genocide-potocari-bosnia-anniversary-b2787123.html', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/bosnia-and-herzegovina-30th-anniversary-of-srebrenica-massacre-a-painful-reminder-from-history/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7HtmjhVD8', 'https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/07/11/thousands-gather-to-mark-the-30th-anniversary-of-genocide-in-srebrenica']"

**Key points about the UK-France migrant deal:**

- The agreement allows the **UK to return migrants** who enter the country on small boats back to France. For each migrant returned, the UK will accept an asylum seeker from France through a safe and legal route—provided they have not previously tried to enter the UK illegally[1][2][3].
- The deal is initially being introduced as a **pilot program**, with no fixed numbers publicly agreed upon by the two governments yet, although reports suggest that **around 50 people per week** may be returned to France[1][2][3].
- **Families will not be split**; the initial focus will be on adults, who will be held in removal centres in the UK before being sent back to France[1].
- Yvette Cooper described the ""one in, one out"" agreement as a step-by-step pilot, emphasizing that not fixing numbers at this stage is deliberate to make sure the program proceeds effectively and withstands potential legal scrutiny[2].
- This arrangement follows years of failed attempts by previous UK governments to secure a similar returns agreement with France, especially after Brexit ended participation in the EU's Dublin Agreement, which had previously governed returns of asylum seekers[2][3].
- The number of people affected is relatively small compared to the overall number of cross-Channel arrivals (about 21,000 this year so far), but the UK government has described it as a ""groundbreaking"" step[3].

Yvette Cooper's assertion that the deal is ""robust"" against legal challenges likely refers to the cautious, pilot-based rollout, clear eligibility criteria, and the reciprocal nature of the agreement, which may help it withstand judicial review. However, full details on legal safeguards or potential points of challenge have not been released publicly[2].

In summary, the headline reflects Cooper's confidence in the legal soundness of this new bilateral migration arrangement, which is seen as a significant shift in UK-France cooperation on Channel crossings[1][2][3].","['https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-the-uk-france-migrant-returns-deal-who-will-be-returned-and-how-many-13395335', 'https://news.sky.com/story/uk-has-not-fixed-numbers-yet-on-how-many-migrants-to-be-returned-to-france-under-deal-home-sec-reveals-13395258', 'https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/07/11/migration-france-agrees-to-return-deal-with-uk_6743267_4.html', 'https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/uk-france-and-uk-eu-cooperation-on-small-boat-arrivals-what-are-the-options/', 'https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-france-agree-major-deal-to-crack-down-on-illegal-channel-crossings']"

Martínez was seeking reelection for the opposition National Party in the upcoming elections.

Reports, such as those from Al Jazeera and echoed in discussions around the proposal, describe how Israel’s plans involve creating so-called “humanitarian cities” or “safe zones” within or near Gaza, where displaced Palestinians would be housed under strict conditions. Critics argue that these zones would effectively function as restricted areas, controlling the movement and activities of Palestinians, and would not offer a genuine solution but rather serve to further displace people from their homes—potentially pushing them out of Gaza entirely[1]. 

UNRWA and other humanitarian organizations have warned that Gaza risks turning into a site of forced displacement, with conditions described as reminiscent of historical concentration or internment camps. The debate centers on whether these plans provide real humanitarian relief or merely present an illusion of choice, while actually forcing people out of the region[1]. 

The discourse around these proposals highlights deep concerns about human rights, autonomy, and the long-term safety and freedom of Gaza’s population.",['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWZfEupwPv8']

Here is a breakdown of the developments and market reaction:

- **Trump's Tariff Announcements:** Trump stated plans to impose a 35% tariff on imports from Canada starting August 1 and indicated that most other countries would face import levies of 15% to 20%, increased from the previous 10%. He sent letters to over 20 countries warning of these tariffs unless new deals are made before August[1].
- **Market Reaction:** Investors grew concerned that these tariffs could spur higher inflation and damage global economic growth. As a result:
  - **US stock indices retreated** from recent all-time highs. The S&P 500 was down by 0.3% to 0.4%, the Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.1% to 0.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% in early trading[4][5].
  - **Bond yields rose**, indicating a selloff in US Treasuries as investors responded to the inflationary risks associated with tariffs[4].
  - The **US dollar strengthened** against other currencies, as the trade tensions heightened global demand for perceived safe-haven assets like the dollar[5].
- **Sector Impact:** Major technology stocks, which had led the market rally, traded mostly lower, though losses were modest. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Broadcom, and Tesla were all down less than 1%[1].

The combination of increased tariff threats, inflationary fears, and a flight to the US dollar contributed to the pullback in equities and uptick in government bond yields. This marked a shift from the previous rally, as markets adjusted expectations for potential disruptions to trade and higher costs for businesses and consumers[1][4][5].","['https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-07112025-11770329', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-RSQ-UGJ_8', 'https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/07/markets-stocks-new-trump-tariff-annoucement-and-other-finance-news/', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/us-stock-market-live-dow-snp-500-nasdaq-trump-russia-canada-tariffs-sanctions-crude-gold-dollar-impact-liveblog-19635416.htm', 'https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/stocks-fall-as-trumps-trade-threats-lift-dollar:-markets-wrap/89664032']"

This deal underscores Ferrero’s aggressive expansion strategy in the US packaged food market.

Under the leadership of the Ferrero family, this acquisition marks the group’s twenty-first major purchase, highlighting a decade-long trend of aggressive growth through strategic buyouts. Ferrero will pay $23 per share for WK Kellogg, a deal approved by Kellogg’s board, and will gain control of iconic American cereal brands such as Special K, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, and Froot Loops[1][5][3]. Upon completion, expected in the second half of 2025, WK Kellogg will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Ferrero[1][5].

This move follows previous major acquisitions by Ferrero, including the purchase of Nestlé’s confectionery business and several other sweet makers, as part of its plan to build a global portfolio of iconic brands and strengthen its presence in North America[3][4].

While most of these deals are **exclusive to Amazon Prime members**, some are available to all shoppers, and new deals can appear throughout the day, especially as “Lightning Deals” that may only last a few hours or while supplies last[2][3]. Early coverage indicates that many of these prices are among the lowest seen all year, though experts note that later events like Black Friday could bring similar or better discounts on some items[2].

Why Nvidia, Bitcoin Point to a FOMO Trade and 5 Other Things to Know Today. - Barron's","JPMorgan Chase CEO **Jamie Dimon** is warning investors that financial markets are showing **complacency** regarding the potential impact of tariffs, especially amid escalating trade tensions under recent U.S. policy moves[1][2][5]. Speaking at an event in Ireland, Dimon criticized the market’s current attitude, suggesting that investors have become too comfortable with unpredictable tariff threats, particularly those coming from former President Trump. He referenced the market’s reliance on what some call the “TACO trade” (“Trump Always Chickens Out”), criticizing the notion that the U.S. administration will always pull back from harsh tariff measures at the last minute[1].

Dimon’s concerns are especially pointed given that the U.S. has recently imposed some of its **highest tax levels on imports in decades**, with new threats of further tariffs—such as a possible 35% tariff on some Canadian goods and broad 15% to 20% blanket tariffs on other trading partners[3]. He believes the probability of higher U.S. interest rates is being dramatically underestimated by the market, which is only pricing in about a 20% chance, whereas he assesses the risk at 40-50%[2][4].

The **headline’s reference to Nvidia and Bitcoin pointing to a FOMO trade** reflects that, despite these headwinds, certain assets like Nvidia (NVDA) shares and Bitcoin (BTC) are being driven largely by **fear of missing out**—investors’ desire to chase winners despite broader macroeconomic uncertainties[2]. This dynamic is happening as U.S. stock indices have recently experienced significant volatility, with declines in the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq following new tariff announcements, yet markets are still hovering near all-time highs[2][5].

Other key points in today’s market landscape include:
- Ongoing **volatility** in global equity markets due to tariff announcements and uncertainty over U.S.-China relations[2].
- Warnings from both Dimon and other major money managers that markets are ignoring red flags like tariffs and rising interest rates as stocks approach record levels[5].

Overall, Dimon's warning serves as a notable caution for investors: **don’t underestimate the risks posed by tariffs and interest rate hikes, even as some market sectors appear to be running on FOMO rather than fundamentals**[1][2][5].","['https://fortune.com/2025/07/11/jamie-dimon-trump-trade-tariffs-ubs-markets-stability/', 'https://www.ainvest.com/news/tariffs-impact-market-complacency-fomo-trade-2507/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUpicLPzxOo', 'https://www.businessinsider.com/jamie-dimon-higher-chance-of-interest-rate-hikes-than-expected-2025-7', 'https://www.axios.com/2025/07/11/jamie-dimon-stock-market']"

After nearly two decades, Apple has ended support for Intel-based Macs, marking the close of an era in which annual hardware refreshes were more important due to dependency on Intel's release cycles and limitations[2][4].

Now, with *Apple Silicon* (its own series of processors), Apple has more control over hardware development and can set its own pace for updates. This autonomy means that **Apple no longer needs to release new MacBook models every year**. In fact, recent reports indicate that Apple will skip a refresh of the MacBook Pro with the new M5 chip in 2025, pushing the next major update to the first half of 2026[1]. The current M4-based MacBook Pro models, released in late 2024, may remain current for a longer period, and bigger design changes—including OLED displays and new case designs—are not expected until 2027[1].

This slower cadence is possible because Apple Silicon has created a leap in performance and efficiency, allowing existing models to remain competitive for longer. The shift also reflects the fact that Apple's innovations are no longer tied to Intel's chip release timelines, enabling more deliberate and strategic product cycles[1][2][4].","['https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/', 'https://tedium.co/2025/06/09/apple-wwdc-intel-mac-support-ending/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhv2uIdc_2I', 'https://www.idropnews.com/news/most-intel-macs-are-now-considered-vintage-products/244442/', 'https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-introduces-the-new-macbook-air-with-the-m4-chip-and-a-sky-blue-color/']"

Multiple sources report that in Geekbench 6.4 tests, the Z Flip7 equipped with Exynos 2500 achieved a **single-core score around 2,012** and a **multi-core score around 7,563**[2][3][4]. This is **notably lower than last year’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3** and even falls short of the Exynos 2500’s own earlier prototype scores, where it managed 2,359 (single-core) and 8,141 (multi-core) on a Galaxy S25+ test mule[2].

Key details from the benchmarks:

- **CPU specs**: One prime core at 3.3 GHz, two performance cores at 2.75 GHz, five performance cores at 2.36 GHz, two efficiency cores at 1.80 GHz—all based on last-generation Arm v8 architecture[2][3].
- **Memory/GPU**: 12 GB RAM and Xclipse 950 GPU[2][3].
- **Performance comparison**: The Exynos 2500’s CPU performance is ""merely on par"" with last year’s top Snapdragon, and well behind new chipsets like the Snapdragon 8 Elite[1][2][3][4].
- **Possible cause**: Analysts suggest Samsung may have **compromised on performance to improve chip yields** using its new 3 nm fabrication process[2].
- **GPU results**: The Exynos 2500’s RDNA 3-based Xclipse 950 GPU performed better, trading blows with the Snapdragon 8 Elite in OpenCL tests (18,601 vs. 18,365), indicating competitive graphics capability[1].

The company is backed by Y Combinator.

Apolink’s mission is to solve a major challenge in satellite communications: keeping satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) connected in real time, 24/7. Satellites often lose connection during parts of their orbit when they are out of the line of sight of ground stations, creating dead zones that interrupt data transmission. While relay satellites and global ground station networks help reduce this downtime, the issue is not completely resolved[3].

Apolink is developing a network that aims to provide persistent, uninterrupted connectivity to LEO satellites, with each orbital ring able to support 256 users simultaneously at 9.6 kbps. This is especially critical as the space industry shifts toward greater reliance on commercial satellite communications providers, particularly with NASA phasing out its legacy Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) system for geostationary satellites and transitioning to commercial solutions[3]. 

By focusing on LEO, Apolink is targeting a segment that has not been as thoroughly addressed by existing commercial systems, which mostly concentrate on geostationary or medium Earth orbits[3]. This young founder and their company are thus aiming to fill a crucial gap in the growing space economy.","['https://aerospace.org/tc-disrupt-2023-space-stage-sessions', 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/jack-dorsey-working-on-bluetooth-messaging-app-bitchat/', 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/yc-backed-apolink-by-19-year-old-bags-4-3m-to-build-24-7-connectivity-for-leo-satellites/', 'https://techcrunch.com/category/space/', 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/06/at-least-36-new-tech-unicorns-were-minted-in-2025-so-far/']"

According to multiple credible sources, here’s what to expect:

- **iPhone 17** will be available in **Black, Silver, Blue, Green, and Purple**[1].
- The all-new **iPhone 17 Air**—which is expected to replace the Plus model and feature a notably thin design—will come in **Black, Silver, Light Gold, and Light Blue**[1]. Notably, the **main color** for the iPhone 17 Air is rumored to be a **unique light blue** that is lighter than any blue Apple has previously released, with some reports likening its subtlety to the “Sierra Blue” finish from the iPhone 13 Pro, but even lighter—almost white in low light[3].

For the **iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max**, leaks suggest the introduction of a **Sky Blue** finish, inspired by the popular hue of the M4 MacBook Air. This indicates a **larger shakeup** in Apple’s color strategy, with the introduction of the new Air model and the possible discontinuation of titanium finishes on Pro models prompting a broader revision of available colors[2].

These leaks align with a broader trend of Apple experimenting with more diverse and lighter pastel shades in its product lineup, aiming to refresh its appeal and provide more personalized options for users[2][3].

The information primarily comes from accessory leaks (like camera protector colors) and established tech leakers in Asia, but as with all pre-launch reports, **details may change before the official launch**[1][3].","['https://www.iclarified.com/97849/iphone-17-and-17-air-color-options-allegedly-revealed-in-new-leak', 'https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/25/iphone-17-colors-could-see-big-shakeup-this-year-heres-why/', 'https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-standout-color-option/', 'https://ts2.tech/en/apple-iphone-17-lineup-latest-rumors-leaks-2025/', 'https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/apple-iphone-17-17-air-all-colors-leak.html']"

The album marks his first full-length project since *Justice* in 2021, ending a four-year hiatus during which Bieber faced significant personal challenges, including a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome that forced him to cancel his world tour in 2022[2][4].

*Swag* consists of 21 new tracks, showcasing a notable roster of collaborators such as Gunna, Sexyy Red, Druski, and Dijon, with production contributions from artists like Daniel Caesar and Carter Lang, and significant songwriting input from Tobias Jesso Jr. The album explores a range of themes—from introspection and vulnerability to personal growth and forgiveness—highlighted by tracks like “All I Can Take,” “Go Baby,” “Therapy Session,” and “Forgiveness.”[2][4]

The release was unexpected, with Bieber teasing the album through a series of billboards in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Reykjavík, featuring striking imagery that hints at the album’s focus on family and personal evolution[4]. The album is described as both darker and more experimental than his previous work, reflecting a mature and reflective phase in Bieber’s career and life.

Fans and critics alike are noting that *Swag* brings a fresh, introspective R&B sound, signaling a bold new chapter for the pop superstar[2][4].","['https://open.spotify.com/album/5vD5M5VW62LL78Ko8x0CVZ', 'https://axs.tv/news-story/justin-bieber-releases-surprise-new-album-swag/', 'https://shop.justinbiebermusic.com', 'https://www.vinylmeplease.com/blogs/music-industry-news/justin-biebers-swag-a-bold-return-to-music-after-four-years', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxXWJv1Al8']"

While the search results do not show the full original BBC article, they provide context about common mistakes and misrepresentations related to London and British life in media.

Several sources note that both British and international productions often get details about London wrong, which can irritate actual Londoners and attentive viewers. Common mistakes include:

- **Geographical inaccuracies:** TV shows and films often conflate locations, suggesting unrealistic travel times or placing characters in impossible journeys across the city[2].
- **Cultural misunderstandings:** Productions might misrepresent the diverse social life, local customs, or the real vibrancy and complexity of London neighborhoods[2].
- **Practical errors:** Series like the BBC's ""In The Club"" have been criticized for mistakes in everyday details—childcare regulations, social services, or even how people use the city’s public spaces[1].

There is a broader pattern of frustration among viewers when creators gloss over or simplify the realities of life in London, whether for dramatic convenience or international appeal. This contributes to a sometimes inauthentic portrayal, which stands out especially to locals familiar with the city’s nuances[2].

The headline likely reflects on these recurring issues, highlighting how the real London contrasts with its on-screen representations. If you are looking for analysis or specific examples, these typically include mix-ups in public transport logistics, over-romanticized or outdated stereotypes, and incorrect details about daily life, all of which detract from authenticity and can be ""too much"" for those who know the city well[2][1].","['https://rocknrollerbaby.co.uk/bbcs-in-the-club/', 'https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/netflix-you-london-mistakes/', 'https://forums.digitalspy.com/discussion/1239934/great-movie-mistakes-bbc-three/p4', 'https://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2011/06/26/report-from-london-final-thoughts/', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6005582/BBC-period-show-The-Tudors-is-historically-inaccurate-leading-historian-says.html']"

Facing the Los Angeles Lakers, Flagg's Mavericks secured an 87-85 victory in a closely contested matchup against a team featuring Bronny James[2].

Flagg's individual performance was a mix of **struggles and flashes of promise**. Statistically, he finished with:

- **10 points** (on 5-for-21 shooting, including 0-for-5 from three-point range)
- **6 rebounds**
- **4 assists**
- **3 steals**
- **1 key block** with just over a minute left, helping secure the win[1][2][4]

While Flagg was dissatisfied with his shooting and overall offensive performance, calling it ""one of the worst games of my life"" and ""not up to my standard,"" his defensive contributions and all-around hustle drew praise from both his coach and teammates[1][2][4]. Mavericks Summer League coach Josh Broghamer cited Flagg’s ability to ""make the right play over and over again"" and emphasized his knack for making ""winning plays, whether it's offense or defense""[1].

Despite his stoic demeanor throughout the evening—including his arrival at the arena and warmups—Flagg demonstrated the attributes that led Dallas to select him with the No. 1 overall pick: unselfishness, tenacity, and versatility[2][4]. His efforts electrified a packed arena, even if his offensive rhythm was off, and his teammates highlighted his unselfish, winning mentality and ability to defend multiple positions[4].

Horner, who led the team for over 20 years and oversaw both the Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen eras of dominance, leaves as Red Bull endures its worst stretch in years[1][2][4].

Key challenges facing Red Bull include:

- **Performance Decline:** After winning all but one race in 2023, Red Bull’s competitiveness has sharply dropped. By mid-2025, both world titles were considered out of reach, with the RB21 struggling to maintain pace except in a very narrow operating window. Attempts to broaden that window have sacrificed peak performance, unlike rivals such as McLaren, who have managed to develop a more adaptable car[1].
- **Operational Weaknesses:** Several key staff departures, notably Jonathan Wheatley and engineering mastermind Adrian Newey, have hit the team hard. This has manifested in increased pitstop errors, questionable strategy calls (such as the hard tyre choice in Barcelona), and general operational inconsistency. The low point came at the Bahrain Grand Prix with a series of mistakes prompting internal crisis talks[1][2].
- **Leadership Transition:** Laurent Mekies is stepping in as the new team principal and Red Bull F1 CEO. Replacing a figure as influential as Horner, who was viewed as central to the team’s identity and success, poses an enormous leadership challenge. The transition’s impact on morale, team culture, and the ability to retain and attract top talent remains uncertain[2][4].
- **Star Talent Uncertainty:** The future of Max Verstappen, now at a crossroads, is a major question mark. Horner’s inability to prevent key figures — including Verstappen’s close allies — from leaving, coupled with the team’s downturn, raises doubts about the Dutch driver’s commitment to stay[2].
- **Shareholder Pressure and Internal Dynamics:** The narrative that individuals, rather than the collective, ensured Red Bull’s success no longer holds sway, especially with Thai shareholders scrutinizing the leadership and results. This shift in management philosophy may lead to deeper structural or strategic changes within the organization[1].

The abrupt change in leadership has shocked the team and its staff, with Horner himself admitting he was blindsided by the decision. The team’s next steps, both on and off track, will be critical as Red Bull attempts to regroup from a period that has brought its ambitious, winning machine to a halt[2][3][4].","['https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/biggest-challenges-red-bull-faces-sacking-christian-horner/10741221/', 'https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-says-red-bull-sacking-came-as-a-shock-in-goodbye-speech-to-staff/10740870/', 'https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/45703816/christian-horner-shock-red-bull-sacking', 'https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/heres-everything-that-went-wrong-for-sacked-red-bull-boss-christian-horner/10740805/', 'https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/whats-next-for-sacked-red-bull-boss-christian-horner/10740975/']"

It was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, with its unusual trajectory quickly indicating an origin from outside our Solar System[1][3][4].

**Key details about 3I/ATLAS:**

- **Origin:** 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019). Its trajectory suggests it may originate from the Milky Way’s thick disk, a region of ancient stars above and below the galaxy’s main plane—which would make it a visitor from a completely different part of our galaxy than previous interstellar objects[2].
- **Age:** Researchers suggest it could be the oldest comet ever detected, potentially predating our Solar System by more than three billion years. Estimates indicate it could be over seven billion years old, making it a ""frozen relic"" from the early universe[2].
- **Size and Composition:** The comet is estimated to be up to 20 kilometers wide and is described as ""water ice-rich."" Its size and physical properties are still under investigation[1][3].
- **Trajectory and Safety:** As of July 2025, 3I/ATLAS is about 670 million kilometers from the Sun. It will make its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025, passing just inside the orbit of Mars, at a safe distance from Earth—no closer than 240 million kilometers (1.6 astronomical units)[1][3].
- **Scientific Interest:** The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it could provide new insights into the composition and origins of comets from outside our Solar System, potentially helping astronomers understand more about the early universe and the processes that shaped our galaxy[2][4].

In summary, 3I/ATLAS is not only a rare interstellar visitor but also potentially the oldest comet ever observed, offering scientists a unique opportunity to study material that may have formed before the birth of our Solar System[2][1][3].","['https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Planetary_Defence/ESA_tracks_rare_interstellar_comet', 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250711082920.htm', 'https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/planetary-defense/2025/07/02/nasa-discovers-interstellar-comet-moving-through-solar-system/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYnZk-rdxXA', 'https://www.space.com/astronomy/comets/new-interstellar-object-3i-atlas-everything-we-know-about-the-rare-cosmic-visitor']"

In December 2024, the probe completed a record-breaking close approach, coming just 3.8 million miles from the solar surface and passing through this superheated layer, much closer than any previous spacecraft[1][4].

During this daring flyby, Parker captured **stunning, high-resolution images and unprecedented data** on the corona and the **solar wind**—the stream of charged particles constantly flowing from the Sun and influencing space weather across the Solar System[1][2][4]. Among the most jaw-dropping findings:

- The probe recorded intricate details of the Sun’s corona, including structures and behaviors in the solar wind that had never been observed before[1][2].
- It documented the phenomenon of “switchbacks”—zig-zagging kinks in the solar wind. These features challenge existing theories about how the wind is accelerated and how the Sun’s magnetic fields interact with these flows[2].
- Parker’s instruments are providing insight into why the corona is **millions of degrees hotter than the Sun’s surface**, a long-standing mystery in solar physics[3].
- Recent studies from the probe’s data have also found evidence for a “helicity barrier” in the corona, further shaping our understanding of the Sun’s complex magnetic environment[3].

These discoveries are not just dramatic images or scientific curiosities; they are vital for understanding and forecasting **space weather**, which impacts Earth’s satellites, communications, power grids, GPS, and the safety of astronauts in space[1][2][4].

The mission is ongoing, with Parker set for even closer passes in the coming year, promising even more groundbreaking insights into our nearest star[1].","['https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/parker-solar-probe-flyby-december-2024', 'https://opentools.ai/news/nasas-parker-solar-probe-unlocking-the-suns-fiery-secrets', 'https://www.iflscience.com/nasas-parker-solar-probe-finds-evidence-of-barrier-in-the-suns-2-million-kelvin-atmosphere-79933', 'https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/news/parker-solar-probe-flyby-december-2024', 'https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/parker-solar-probe/2025/06/23/parker-solar-probe-completes-24th-close-approach-to-sun/']"

Specifically, during July and August 2025, Earth is experiencing days that are **1.3 to 1.6 milliseconds shorter** than the standard 24-hour day[1][3][5]. The shortest day occurred on July 5, 2024, when Earth's rotation completed **1.66 milliseconds faster than usual**[1]. For 2025, the days predicted to be notably shorter are July 9, July 22, and August 5, each with a rotation completed between **1.3 and 1.5 milliseconds quicker** than average[1][5].

This phenomenon is mainly driven by a combination of complex factors:
- **Lunar position:** During these specific summer dates, the **Moon is at its farthest from the equator (maximum declination)**, which changes the gravitational influence on Earth and increases its rotational speed slightly[3][5].
- **Mass shifts within Earth:** Melting polar ice, movements in Earth's liquid core, and other internal geophysical changes can alter how mass is distributed, affecting how quickly the planet spins[2].
- **Temporary reversal of the usual trend:** Normally, Earth's rotation gradually slows over centuries due to the Moon's tidal pull, adding about 2 milliseconds to a day every 100 years. However, short-term variations can make the planet spin a bit faster due to the above mechanisms[1][5].

Despite these changes being imperceptible to humans—since a millisecond is a thousandth of a second—these shifts matter for scientific accuracy and can affect timekeeping systems. If the trend continues, experts suggest we might eventually need to add a ""negative leap second"" to keep atomic clocks synchronized with Earth's precise rotation[2].

In summary, the headline highlights a real and measurable, but minuscule, acceleration in Earth's spin during the summer of 2025, leading to a few days that are the shortest ever observed by modern scientific instruments[1][3][5].","['https://explorersweb.com/earth-is-spinning-faster/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OOJaRKMdMA', 'https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/earth-just-had-a-freakishly-short-day-but-the-fastest-day-of-the-year-is-yet-to-come', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/earths-faster-spin-may-cause-shorter-days-scientists-warn-should-you-be-concerned/articleshow/122234527.cms', 'https://www.space.com/astronomy/earth/did-you-feel-it-earth-just-had-one-of-its-shortest-days-ever-and-2-more-are-coming']"

This find occurred as part of a separate initiative: the museum was drilling deep test holes—nearly **1,000 feet below ground**—to evaluate the potential for switching its heating and cooling systems to geothermal energy[1][3][5]. 

During this **geothermal drilling project**—supported by a state grant—the museum’s researchers took the opportunity to extract geological cores for scientific study. In January 2025, while drilling through sediment and ancient rock layers, they uncovered a **partial dinosaur bone dating back about 67.5 to 70 million years**, from the Late Cretaceous Period[1][3][5]. This layer dates to just before the mass extinction that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs.

The fossil is believed to be **part of a vertebra from a large plant-eating dinosaur**. According to the museum, this is both the **deepest and oldest dinosaur bone ever found inside Denver’s city limits**[3][5]. The land during the Late Cretaceous, where the bone was found, would have looked completely different: it was a lush, tropical forest with towering palm trees and dense vegetation[3].

Museum staff described the find as extremely rare and scientifically valuable, especially since discoveries of this sort almost never happen as a result of deep drilling for engineering or energy projects[3][5].

The individual showed severe symptoms and died the same day they arrived at the hospital. Rapid diagnostic testing and an autopsy confirmed the presence of **Yersinia pestis**, the bacterium responsible for plague[1][3][4][5].

This case drew attention because it occurred **amid a prairie dog die-off near Flagstaff**, an event often associated with increased plague activity, since rodents like prairie dogs commonly carry fleas that can transmit the disease to humans. Local health officials are currently investigating these prairie dog deaths and are working to collect and test fleas from the area[4].

**Plague is now rare in the United States**, with the CDC reporting an average of **seven human cases annually**, mostly in rural areas of the western U.S., including northern Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. Infections typically occur after humans are bitten by fleas from infected rodents or after handling infected animals. **Symptoms** usually develop within two to six days and may include fever and swollen, painful lymph nodes (buboes).[1][4] Although **plague is treatable with antibiotics** if caught early, it can be fatal if not treated promptly[1].

According to the report, the sudden—and in many cases substantial—withdrawal of U.S. funding, including cuts to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), threatens to reverse hard-won gains that have saved millions of lives, especially in sub-Saharan Africa[2][1]. UNAIDS estimates that, if the funding shortfall is not addressed, an additional six million people could be newly infected by 2029, and there could be four million more AIDS-related deaths in the next four years[2].

The report highlights the urgent need for countries and communities to step up their own responses and for international partners to restore or replace lost funding to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic. The impact is already being felt, with many HIV organizations, especially those led by women, having lost funding or having to suspend critical services[3][5].

This marks a significant increase from previous estimates, which had put the rate at about 1 in 5 teens (around 18%)[4].

**Prediabetes** is a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes. Youth with prediabetes are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other serious health problems[2][4].

However, the report has been met with **skepticism by some experts** due to the limited information released by the CDC. Instead of providing a detailed, peer-reviewed publication, the agency shared only a brief 600-word online summary. The CDC also reportedly changed its methodology for calculating prediabetes rates but did not thoroughly explain these changes[2][4]. This lack of transparency and context, especially following recent staff cuts at the agency, has led to concerns about the reliability and interpretation of the data.
