"As Texas Flood Raged, Camp Mystic Was Left to Fend for Itself - The New York Times",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5KMlZ6M2FwT1VaTGNNeXNaS3RzVUl2ZTNaUEpTVk9WMkN4Y1JGZWQ3cmJ5elVUZHpDM2k4UVNKUE9NSG1Qc2QtQjNmOHpVWUlaREg4SFhkUWdIRjYwVF91Vm1QVVFfTlNhdUN1STJNSEJTdE1iREplNg?oc=5,"The headline ""As Texas Flood Raged, Camp Mystic Was Left to Fend for Itself"" from The New York Times refers to the catastrophic flash flooding that struck Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp for girls on the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, Texas, during the early hours of July 4, 2025[3]. As torrential rains caused the river to rise rapidly, floodwaters surged through the camp in the middle of the night, catching many by surprise and overwhelming the area with little warning[3].

At the time of the disaster, more than 750 children and staff were present at Camp Mystic[3]. Many local officials and emergency responders reportedly were not aware of the severity or the immediacy of the unfolding catastrophe, leaving those at the camp and along the river largely on their own to deal with the crisis as it happened. Testimonies from campers describe waking up to water-filled cabins and realizing that something was terribly wrong only after floodwaters had already begun to inundate their accommodations[1].

The aftermath was devastating: at least 27 lives were lost at Camp Mystic, with the overall death toll from the floods in central Texas exceeding 90 as of the following week, and many others still missing[1][3]. The flash flood warning was issued around 1:14 a.m., but the rapid rise of the river—a reported one foot every three minutes—left little time for effective evacuation or outside intervention[4].

The event highlighted both the speed and ferocity of the flood, as well as gaps in local emergency awareness and response, which contributed to Camp Mystic and others along the river having to ""fend for themselves"" as the disaster unfolded."
Federal judge issues new nationwide block against Trump’s order seeking to end birthright citizenship - CNN,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNeENtY1JhaWNuTk1rdm9yZ1FZQjZackpnckg3NkhwU0wxS256djV0bEh4amhkb2VsTjJFOUZwb0R2cTBVT21ONWIwMklHRUNHZzB0dWsyVmdLRDkwRGt1VDZ0NndyTk9rN3JrSk02cDROVkI4UzFTQ0p0TzRFRmxHMjNYbWNJRTBHZkFB0gGQAUFVX3lxTE9oQmtLZ3VBdkhtNG44OEZ0Z3NtXy1ZdmtMNGdTTGk5eC1MVVFxWGhIcm0wNWxFdEtZbXBWNVhZZFdnaTNFX0Z2WE5kRjZSdnhKVW1QQ2xQVUl1TkZXS0NkTWc3NGN3Z2tmSzZtNEtFMFg0em5wUVdUNzVFQTVfZ3c4YUV0akZEcTFXSDZ5RTBFLQ?oc=5,"A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide block against former President Donald Trump’s executive order that sought to end **birthright citizenship** for children born in the U.S. to parents living in the country illegally or temporarily[1][2][3][5]. This ruling, delivered by District Judge Joseph LaPlante, comes in response to a class-action lawsuit filed shortly after a U.S. Supreme Court decision that had indicated parts of the executive order might proceed[1][2][3][5].

Judge LaPlante’s decision:

- **Certifies a nationwide class** of children affected by Trump’s order, ensuring all impacted children on U.S. soil are protected[1][3][5].
- **Blocks the executive order from taking effect nationwide**, with the injunction delayed for seven days to give the government a chance to seek an emergency stay from the First Circuit Court of Appeals[1][2][5].
- Stresses that Trump's order stands in direct conflict with the **14th Amendment**, which guarantees citizenship to all individuals born in the United States regardless of their parents’ immigration status[3][5].

The judge stated the decision “was not a close call,” pointing out that failure to block the order would cause ""irreparable harm"" to children who risk losing their citizenship rights[2][3].

The legal challenge—led by the ACLU and multiple civil rights organizations—argues that the executive order is unconstitutional and threatens fundamental rights that have long been recognized in U.S. law[1][5]. The class certified by the judge includes all children who would be affected, but is slightly narrower than initially proposed, as it does not currently include their parents[3][5].

The injunction is the latest development in ongoing legal battles over both the scope of presidential authority on immigration and the judiciary’s power to issue nationwide injunctions[3]. Even with the seven-day delay, the order will prevent implementation of Trump’s directive prior to its planned start date at the end of July[1][2]."
Deadly new Russian drone and missile attack hits Kyiv - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1uUWpYNnZrQWxnS0ZUelVxczBwWHpZbWY1dlFpVkpGSElEZUpXUENwejNEQldpQl9TQndFV3p6Nm83NUFPcDZ5cnROS2FDcWpSWmFlZDRGU1lSd9IBX0FVX3lxTFBOVnluSmhUdjRVVkoxQmxSRG50MEdJcjFHNFp5YURMNGg5bTRkYmZkYlMwNlk3UVUyeEQwMi1JUS1HT3pHTGN4QUNubmg0NjIxUF9WS0JEdXFFLWstR3Jj?oc=5,"A **deadly Russian drone and missile attack** struck Kyiv overnight, resulting in at least **two deaths and sixteen injuries**, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy[2][1][3]. The attack was notable both for its scale and intensity:

- **Approximately 400 drones and 18 missiles** were launched, primarily targeting the Ukrainian capital[2][1].
- The bombardment lasted nearly **10 hours** and was part of a broader offensive that also affected several regions beyond Kyiv, including Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, Kirovohrad, and Kharkiv[1].
- Many of the drones used were **Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones**[1][3].
- **Kyiv's central Shevchenkivskyi district** was specifically impacted, with drone debris hitting residential buildings and causing fires across the city[2].
- Ukrainian air defenses **intercepted 14 missiles and 164 drones**, while electronic warfare neutralized many more[1].
- The Russian Defense Ministry claimed the strike targeted military-industrial facilities and a military airfield, stating that all intended targets were hit[1].

This attack follows a pattern of escalating aerial assaults by Russia in recent weeks, including what Ukrainian authorities described as the **largest drone and missile barrage since the full-scale war began**[1][3][5]. President Zelenskyy characterized the ongoing strikes as a **""clear escalation of terror""** against Ukrainian cities, referencing the repeated use of hundreds of drones and continuous nighttime attacks[1][3].

In summary, the headline refers to a significant and sustained Russian air assault on Kyiv, marked by high civilian impact, extensive use of drones and missiles, and representing an intensification in the current conflict dynamics[2][1][3]."
State Sen. Angela Paxton files for divorce from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton - KUT,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxQMndKNXZUV2ptTXlHLUlVMDZrTEdtcXNDSS1PQ0NxUzc0enpKTy1lMFB6MHdSTS10R2V3TzVxRTdBcG1qRElhbVlwSWk0UmNIV21sbW1lSWJOR0pickhIb0dCQkxpOThlbTA5amtCZ0lEeDhEZm9CeWlBUGVxd0JzVFhyM0I5VTVuZTJpXzhkUm15OXB3NWduRXp6UkxXZFJ1NzhfTmowcDBTYkdaZktOTENJOVVhdUN0LWpQag?oc=5,"State Senator **Angela Paxton** has filed for divorce from her husband, **Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton**, as confirmed by court records in Collin County on July 10, 2025[1][2][3]. The couple, who have been married for 38 years, have not lived together since June 1, 2024[1][2][3].

Angela Paxton stated she was seeking divorce **""on biblical grounds""** and accused Ken Paxton of **adultery** in her divorce petition[1][2][3]. In a public statement on social media, she expressed her belief that marriage is a sacred covenant and that she had sought reconciliation, but that recent discoveries led her to conclude continuing the marriage would not honor God or be loving to herself, her children, or Ken Paxton[1][2][3][5].

She is seeking a **disproportionate share of the marital estate**, citing Ken Paxton’s fault in the breakup, his higher earning power, and her claims that he benefitted from her staying with him. She also requests **exclusive use of their home in McKinney** and financial support[2].

Ken Paxton responded publicly, attributing the divorce to the **pressures of political attacks and public scrutiny**, and emphasized his commitment to their family while asking for prayers and privacy[1][2][3][5]. 

The announcement comes at a time when Ken Paxton is running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate[2]."
Internal DOJ messages bolster claim that Trump judicial nominee spoke of defying court orders - Politico,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQNTdDSHlzYmFRelZ3Yk43WXVxT0hoTWdJXzdpWGJBY0N2djl6Zkg3RlZVMEZzQ1lWR2QybTY2bnBndEM3N1ZuSk1ROU5zcEF0UUtmZmwybjVrdGFOSHFVbzNjZXVVVnd2bXFOUVd1eHJwVUZacDVMTkJIaDBvdnFCd0otNFlKNENVcW9B?oc=5,"The **headline** ""Internal DOJ messages bolster claim that Trump judicial nominee spoke of defying court orders"" refers to newly released internal Justice Department communications that support allegations against **Emil Bove**, a judicial nominee of former President Donald Trump. The allegations, brought forward by **Erez Reuveni**, a former DOJ attorney turned whistleblower, claim that Bove discussed or suggested the possibility of **defying federal court orders** while formulating legal strategies for the Trump administration's immigration policies in March 2020[1][2][3][5].

Key points include:
- **Reuveni** provided **emails and text messages** to Congress as evidence that Bove considered ignoring or openly defying court orders, particularly those related to halting deportation flights as directed by Judge James Boasberg[1][3][5].
- In one cited meeting, Bove allegedly remarked that DOJ ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f--- you'"" in response to any order blocking the deportations[3]. Texts from Reuveni further discuss a ""decision point on f--- you"" regarding whether to comply with potential court injunctions[3].
- These allegations emerged just before Bove's confirmation hearing for a seat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a lifetime position that would have him rule on appeals from several states including Pennsylvania and New Jersey[2][4].
- **Bove has denied** instructing anyone at DOJ to violate court orders, stating during his confirmation hearing, ""I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order"" and characterized the accusations as “wildly inaccurate”[1][2][5].
- Supporters of Bove, as well as some Trump officials, have dismissed the allegations as the work of a “disgruntled former employee,” while Senate Democrats and whistleblower advocates say the messages provide clear support for the claims[1][2][3][5].

The situation has raised concerns about the **integrity of the Justice Department’s compliance with the judiciary** and put Bove’s nomination under heightened scrutiny[3][5]."
Verified images show Red Sea ship sinking and aftermath of attack on Kyiv - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE1ycC05cmhmTFJKN2RLS1NTdGJWUm5wa1I4SDUtQnE3NFlTMzFxdnZ2MjVoQVJsbXJULThsT2xXUllzYnY5dG9SR01PbmJZaWZyTnRRYQ?oc=5,"The headline ""Verified images show Red Sea ship sinking and aftermath of attack on Kyiv - BBC"" refers to two major news events:

- **Red Sea ship sinking:** The sinking is linked to attacks by Yemen's Houthi group, who have targeted numerous merchant ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November 2023. These attacks have involved missiles, drones, and small boats, and video evidence has been released showing such incidents[1][2]. One recent incident includes the confirmed sinking of a merchant vessel after a Houthi attack, illustrating the escalation and ongoing threat to maritime security in the region.

- **Aftermath of attack on Kyiv:** The headline also references the aftermath of a separate event—an attack on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. The phrase suggests that there is verified visual evidence documenting the consequences of this attack, such as damage or casualties. While the search results do not provide direct details about this specific event, the inclusion in the BBC headline implies that authenticated images have surfaced depicting the aftermath.

Both events highlight confirmed, visually documented violence in high-profile conflict zones, with a focus on the use of ""verified images"" to underscore the authenticity and severity of what has occurred."
"Freed from ICE detention, Mahmoud Khalil files $20 million claim against Trump administration - AP News",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOSDBQN1EwZVRFLTQxeTVNNEhkcE5tMG5rNXRobE5sN3VFQzNaTGtQdVBrSlpaYjY5c2hTalJGbzRZMkItaGJjcW91UXZqT3IwY2hKNjRnc2JXSkZ5LV9JNV83TXJJVTRQcTBSbXdaeFl6RGZYdzhtdkdrRER5YUJIYUtDUDB2WWlqUmZfZWtfcXJpSTVsN2JhWllsY0piTURoQ091bUFlbTBKc1BVemRZ?oc=5,"**Mahmoud Khalil**, a Columbia University graduate and prominent pro-Palestinian activist, was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention in Louisiana after more than three months in custody. His detention was initiated by the Trump administration, which sought to deport him due to ""foreign policy"" concerns related to his advocacy for Palestinian rights and his role in Columbia campus protests against Israel[1][3][5]. Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, was not charged with any crimes; the administration argued his activities were aligned with Hamas, a claim his supporters say is baseless and politically motivated[5].

After his release, which was ordered by a federal judge who found his detention ""highly unusual"" and determined he posed no threat to the community nor flight risk[1], Khalil reunited with his family in New York[3][5]. He had missed the birth of his child and other significant family milestones during his detention[3]. His case drew widespread support from advocacy groups and public figures, including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called his detainment a violation of his First Amendment rights[5].

On July 10, 2025, Khalil filed a **$20 million claim against the Trump administration**, alleging false imprisonment and significant financial, emotional, and reputational harm resulting from his detention[2][4]. His legal team asserts that his detention was part of a broader effort to silence critics of U.S. and Israeli policy toward Palestinians, and the lawsuit seeks compensation for what they describe as politically motivated targeting[4]."
"As FEMA aids Texas flood victims, Noem urges eliminating US agency 'as it exists today' - Reuters",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPVzBob0dtSXJybzF5S1FmV3c0UzFLbWJaMlNFZXpmcGRKdDBvSi1xeDVTTFNDWjdXeFo2UC1tbkVaSmdlYk4xZkljOGY0U1pfcFQyTWhLR2F3am56ZWtUUFpUcURMNHhuaVRMSkhHVUFrV2taUVY2Uk5RMFBDSlFiM0JtdktfNXRIQ0dYREJNZmVaTk90WEJ4bzhTUnBIbDkyVGYteDRQRlJ4WldwZFBBb0pnNER3cGxRRFUtUjR3c09ScURPZjY4?oc=5,"The headline refers to an ongoing situation in Texas, where **FEMA** (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) is actively assisting in response and recovery after significant flooding caused by heavy storms starting on July 2, 2025. President Trump approved a major disaster declaration, enabling FEMA to provide federal aid to affected Texans, particularly in Kerr County, with support including housing assistance, repairs, and other recovery resources[1][3][4].

At the same time, **Kristi Noem**, who now serves as U.S. Homeland Security Secretary, made public comments urging for the elimination of FEMA ""as it exists today."" This position is notable because, while FEMA is deeply involved in disaster relief operations in Texas, Noem is advocating for a major overhaul or replacement of the agency rather than maintaining its current structure[2]. The context suggests a critique or call for reform of FEMA, even as she oversees its current deployment and publically expresses support for Texas victims.

Noem’s statement appears to reflect a political stance on emergency management policy, possibly indicating dissatisfaction with FEMA’s performance, bureaucracy, or overall mission, though specific details or critiques were not provided in the search results. The situation highlights a contrast: federal disaster relief is being administered through FEMA, but the agency's future is being questioned by a key federal official directly involved in the response[2]."
US imposing sanctions on senior UN official focused on Palestinian human rights - CNN,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNbjZlVV91YXJKQ1RwNGpPRURHUkVDYVVZbTYySE1qNVo2RG1RTko3TW9zaWVhS3hzY0Zna2VTT2M3U3M5dEtFbTJsbVl2b01oSVRCYTZ3OGxyT2ZseW8zbkNrSTYzZVp4dHhYb3JjYjM2YnFhQ0NURkp4UWN5cHpCSGlsUkRDSGwtLTlpNDVvZDdVYzjSAZgBQVVfeXFMTUViWldhcXV2SV9xbGZXYUdUXzdidVZ4Mk1ZcnBXMi1qZHl5VXZJdU8tOWNnUHJjcGJJcTJoaWVNakNwRnJ4ZGFhYTNjUFJkbFhqWDZnOXljT2czczVfdEtRSy1ZeGJLYnJmenJSZlM5SElmc2pLZ3VxeXJTSmN3T1ZQQ3ExWEdXQ04zV0ZkMmExZ0JIX2dTY3U?oc=5,"The headline refers to the **United States imposing sanctions on Francesca Albanese**, the **UN Special Rapporteur on Palestinian human rights**. This action, announced by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, marks a significant escalation in US efforts to shield Israel from international scrutiny over its conduct in Gaza[1][3][4]. 

Rubio justified the sanctions by accusing Albanese of “biased and malicious activities,” promoting “antisemitism,” and “support for terrorism.” He also claimed Albanese was involved in recommending International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutions targeting US and Israeli nationals, which Rubio described as an infringement on sovereignty, since both nations are not parties to the ICC’s Rome Statute[1][3].

Albanese, an Italian lawyer and UN-appointed expert since 2022, has been highly critical of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, labeling them as genocide and advocating for sanctions and arms embargoes against Israel. Her recent reporting also cited US companies as complicit in what she termed “the economy of genocide” connected to the occupation[1].

Top UN officials and human rights organizations have condemned the US move, saying it sets a dangerous precedent by targeting UN officials for their independent human rights work. They warn this undermines the wider international human rights framework and urge the US to reverse the decision[3][5]. 

This is part of a broader pattern in which the US has used sanctions against individuals and organizations critical of Israel’s actions in the occupied Palestinian territories[2][1]."

The incident occurred about 400 feet underground when the tunnel, under construction as part of a nearly **$700 million wastewater project**, suffered a cave-in between the tunnel boring machine and the workers, who were about six miles into the tunnel[1][2][3][4].

The workers had to scramble over a mound of **loose soil and debris**, climbing more than 12 feet high to reach the tunnel boring machine, which served as their escape route. Rescue teams then assisted in transporting them back to the surface, where they were hoisted out in a yellow cage by a crane[1][4]. Despite the dramatic circumstances, **none of the workers sustained major injuries**. All 31 individuals were accounted for and were evaluated by paramedics at the scene[1][2][3][4].

The incident prompted a significant emergency response, with more than 100 Los Angeles Fire Department personnel, including specialized search and rescue teams, dispatched to manage the situation[3]. Officials and the city’s mayor, Karen Bass, expressed relief, noting that what could have been a tragedy ended with every worker safe, describing the outcome as a blessing for Los Angeles[1][2][3].

The tunnel is part of a major infrastructure project for Los Angeles County’s sanitation system, designed to carry treated wastewater 400 feet underground to the Pacific Ocean. Authorities are now investigating the cause of the collapse and will review safety procedures before construction resumes[3][4]."
"Starmer says 'one in, one out' migrant deal with France to begin within weeks - BBC",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE5zTkgycTJlR0NmbHROSVRKOTltMVl5MENyQ3NXVzR4RlliaEpYTHFCTUtxWEpGQ2xWQjlUUW5kRmZRT2IxMjl3aUIzM0FUQnpZdnBfOQ?oc=5,"UK Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** has announced a new deal with France, described as a **""one in, one out"" migrant returns policy**, set to begin within weeks[4][1]. Under this agreement, **undocumented migrants** who arrive in the UK via small boat crossings will be deported back to France. In exchange, the UK will accept an equivalent number of legitimate asylum seekers from France, specifically those who have *genuine claims* and familial ties to Britain[1][2][3][4].

Key details based on the official statements and press coverage:

- **Purpose:** The deal aims to address the record number of people crossing the English Channel illegally, which has reached at least 21,000 in 2025 so far[4][2].
- **How it works:** For each migrant returned to France, the UK will take in one legal asylum seeker through controlled, legal routes, following strict security checks and only if they have not previously attempted illegal entry[4][1][3].
- **Scale:** Reports suggest that, at least initially, up to 50 migrants per week could be returned to France, addressing only a fraction of the total arrivals[2].
- **Implementation:** The agreement is currently a pilot scheme pending legal review and is expected to start in the coming weeks, though the final deal details may still be under negotiation[1][2][4].
- **Enforcement:** The UK government is also intensifying broader enforcement efforts against illegal working, especially in the gig economy, as part of its wider strategy[3][4].

Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron both described the agreement as ""groundbreaking"" and a first of its kind, intended to disrupt people-smuggling networks and deter dangerous crossings by making clear that illegal entry will no longer guarantee a chance to stay in the UK[4][1][3]. The two leaders emphasized that while the deal is a significant step, it is not a ""silver bullet"" but part of a broader, coordinated approach to migration and border security[4]."
Coffee prices climb after Donald Trump threatens 50% tariffs on Brazil - Financial Times,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9KS1Z0eVpMQjJFWk9NYW1obmxJX2NkUVBIbG01WEk0NEFvVzFHYThNSXZKc3FQUDFMTU5LNkZLMmZ6aVR1M3hxemFHckoyOTU1N2IyVUgwWHZuenNIb2g5U3ZlM09QdGxMMThmMWpkR3c?oc=5,"**Coffee prices have surged following Donald Trump's announcement of a proposed 50% tariff on imports from Brazil**, the world's largest coffee producer[1][3]. The move is part of a broader set of tariffs targeting dozens of countries and products, but the Brazil-specific action is particularly significant for coffee because the U.S. imported nearly $2 billion worth of coffee from Brazil last year, accounting for about 20% of total U.S. coffee imports[3].

**The immediate market reaction included a jump in coffee futures, which rose 1.8% early Thursday** after the announcement, reversing a months-long decline from their all-time highs earlier in the year[1]. Analysts warn that this tariff could reverse hopes for a near-term easing of coffee prices, which have already been up almost 12% for consumers over the past year[1]. 

According to an analysis by Reflexivity, **wholesale coffee prices could rise more than 40% from current levels** if the tariff goes into effect, leading to dramatically higher retail prices. For the average consumer, this could mean up to an extra $162 per year in coffee expenses[1]. Industry leaders, including Giuseppe Lavazza of Lavazza, have echoed these concerns, warning that prices could ""rise quite a lot"" as a result[2].

The tariffs are part of a broader trade dispute, with Trump demanding Brazil drop criminal charges against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a close ally. Brazilian officials have promised retaliation, adding further uncertainty to global coffee markets[1].

**In summary:** U.S. coffee drinkers can expect prices to climb sharply if the threatened 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee imports is implemented, as the global supply chain adjusts and inflationary pressures mount[1][2][3]."

The celebration, held on July 10, 2025, featured a four-day party—including a 44-pound cake made entirely of fruits and vegetables for the young hippo[1][3].

Moo Deng quickly rose to fame after her birth, thanks to her keeper Atthapon Nundee, who regularly posted endearing photos and videos online. These social media updates captured moments of Moo Deng being playful and affectionate, which expanded her fanbase worldwide[2][3]. 

The hippo’s name, which means ""bouncy pork"" in Thai, was chosen by fans through a poll, aligning with the playful names of her siblings—Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork)[2]. Moo Deng’s popularity has drawn thousands of visitors to the zoo, and some fans even traveled internationally to attend her birthday celebration[3].

The event also highlighted the zoo’s broader mission of wildlife conservation. Moo Deng is a pygmy hippo, a rare species native to West Africa and classified as threatened due to habitat loss and poaching. Only about 2,000 to 3,000 pygmy hippos remain in the wild, making events like these vital for raising awareness about endangered species[2].

To mark Moo Deng’s birthday, the zoo organized activities and online auctions, offering items such as photos, footprints, and food containers to raise funds for animal care and conservation efforts[5]. Throughout the festivities, Moo Deng was described as “happy, moist and unbothered,” charming visitors and reinforcing her status as a beloved animal ambassador[1]."
US's Rubio makes first Asia visit amid unease over Trump tariffs - Reuters,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNWFljLWRpX1hqNG1lU3k2QlozSnRiUWdCY1lpX280bkFlb19NVEhPWjVlcHpCUDFjZ3l3aEwwU0loaENEeEVZYlFyV0FuX1ZCUG95Rzhwa0sxdjJMOTRwNjBPWllvellmQUxFSkpDQ05iejdmaXZYclNGT0hvc0xhcHdvaDBSOW1Ya2hrb2RMZkNnMGg2REQ4VUNjX0ZUN3pETmdWVw?oc=5,"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is making his first official visit to Asia amid significant concern throughout the region caused by President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs targeting key U.S. allies and partners. Rubio is attending the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he aims to reaffirm U.S. commitments to a ""free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific region"" and to reassure Southeast Asian leaders of Washington’s continued engagement and partnership[1][2].

However, the backdrop of this visit is marked by heightened **unease over tariffs**. Just days before Rubio’s arrival, President Trump announced **steep new tariffs**—including 25% tariffs on Japan and South Korea (both attending the ASEAN conference as delegations, although not members), and 20% tariffs on the Philippines and other ASEAN countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand, effective August 1. Vietnam, having negotiated a separate deal, will face a lower, but still significant, 20% tariff[1][2].

These trade measures have unsettled U.S. partners in the region, many of whom are major exporters and have benefitted from supply chain shifts away from China. The **export-dependent ASEAN bloc is collectively the world’s fifth-largest economy**, making Washington’s tariff strategy especially impactful[2]. Rubio’s visit is therefore seen as an attempt to manage the fallout from these economic measures and push back against China’s growing influence, even as regional leaders are wary of being forced to take sides between Washington and Beijing[1][2].

Experts note that, despite Rubio’s stated focus on security and regional cooperation rather than trade, the shadow of the tariffs looms large over his meetings. He is expected to reiterate the U.S. need to “rebalance” trade relationships, while also seeking to persuade ASEAN members that the U.S. remains a more reliable partner than China[2]."

- The **consensus price target** is around **$174–$175**, with some targets extending up to $200, and most analysts maintaining a “buy” rating[1][2][3].
- Year-to-date, the stock has gained over 21%, and about 25% over the past 12 months[1][2].
- Technical analysis points to a continued bullish trend, underpinned by recent chart formations like the “golden cross” and Tesla’s breakouts above previous highs, supporting further upside momentum[1][3].

Nvidia’s rally is heavily attributed to:
- **Surging AI chip demand** (notably the H200 and B200 chips powering major AI platforms and data centers)
- **Government contracts** (such as the U.S. “Stargate” AI supercomputing project)
- **Dominance in AI infrastructure and the CUDA software ecosystem**, making Nvidia indispensable for developers and enterprise clients in AI[1].

In summary, Nvidia's record-breaking $4 trillion valuation reflects both current dominance and high expectations for future growth, and investors are watching these identified price levels closely to assess the potential for continued gains or possible pullbacks[1][2][3][4]."
Ferrero to take over US breakfast cereal giant Kellogg - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE8yM0kxdXhTMmNybmN5UDBVNGVuM08wSS1CV2s2SEFuczY3Vl9MSXNvcXFyT0RKZXhwR3R4SWN2Z3hndUkyNEFmeDRmNmNrTDdXUk1iYzRQa2hOZw?oc=5,"Italian confectionery giant **Ferrero**, best known for Nutella, has announced a deal to acquire **WK Kellogg Co**, the iconic American breakfast cereal maker, for **$3.1 billion**[1][2]. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrero will purchase all outstanding equity of WK Kellogg Co for **$23 per share in cash**, a price that represents a 40% premium over the stock’s recent 30-day average trading price[1][3].

The acquisition includes the **manufacturing, marketing, and distribution** of WK Kellogg Co’s well-known cereal brands—such as Froot Loops, Frosted Flakes, Special K, and Rice Krispies—across the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean[2]. This move enables Ferrero to **expand its North American footprint** and diversify its product portfolio, which already includes brands like Nutella, Kinder, Tic Tac, Ferrero Rocher, Butterfinger, Keebler, and Famous Amos[1][2].

WK Kellogg Co was formed in 2023 when Kellogg split its snack and cereal businesses, creating Kellanova for snacks (such as Cheez-Its and Pringles) and retaining WK Kellogg Co for cereal[2]. With this acquisition, Ferrero continues its recent strategy of high-profile U.S. takeovers, having previously acquired Nestlé’s U.S. candy brands and ice cream maker Wells Enterprises[2].

The deal is pending shareholder approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Once finalized, WK Kellogg Co will become a **subsidiary of Ferrero** and its stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange[2]."
The CEO who never was: how Linda Yaccarino was set up to fail at Elon Musk’s X - The Guardian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPc2JXUHgyTnJwYnlOXzBCYlA4dVh6eVBNQ0FVcm9ROC1RbThyMS1sUjlocTY0SjZaY0ZmU25odjZUajJLS0x2dUI4RHNuYXRGVjdBeUYtQ25xRXh1R0tvWEwzS244NXlWZURfaU43c1VqNThaRVZVVmhPTlVMRElQTEUxZjFGUnlFX1N6X1NVbw?oc=5,"The headline from The Guardian—*“The CEO who never was: how Linda Yaccarino was set up to fail at Elon Musk’s X”*—reflects widespread analysis and commentary regarding **Linda Yaccarino’s tumultuous tenure as CEO of X (formerly Twitter)** under Elon Musk’s ownership. Yaccarino, a respected media executive, was brought in by Musk in 2023 largely to repair relationships with advertisers and bring corporate stability to a platform reeling from mass firings, reputational issues, and Musk’s unpredictable management style[1][3]. 

**Key points underscoring the notion she was “set up to fail”:**

- **Advertiser Exodus:** Musk’s changes to the platform, including a shift towards less content moderation, led many major advertisers to exit X. Yaccarino was hired specifically to win them back, a challenge that proved nearly impossible as platform controversies—such as the spread of hate speech and disinformation—continued unabated[2][3][4].
- **Glass Cliff Concerns:** Media coverage at the time of her appointment raised the “glass cliff” scenario, where women are handed leadership over organizations in crisis and are then blamed when recovery proves elusive. Yaccarino herself acknowledged disappointment over implications that she hadn’t earned her role[3].
- **Musk’s Dominance:** Despite her CEO title, Musk maintained outsized influence over X’s day-to-day direction, undermining her ability to enact lasting change or reassure advertisers that the platform was under stable management[1][3][4].
- **AI & Merger Turmoil:** Her resignation followed the controversial merger of X with Musk’s AI company, xAI, as well as scandals surrounding the platform’s AI chatbot pushing antisemitic content. Although sources said her resignation was not directly tied to the Grok controversy, the timing added to perceptions of a chaotic and hostile work environment[2].
- **Industry Perception:** Publications like *Fortune* and *The New Republic* noted Yaccarino struggled to restrain Musk’s most damaging impulses and failed to significantly alter the advertiser exodus. She was described as one of 2023’s most embattled CEOs, hamstrung by her inability—or Musk’s unwillingness—to give her effective power[3].

Yaccarino’s resignation in July 2025, after just two years, capped a period of instability in which her efforts to stabilize and rehabilitate X were **undermined by persistent internal and external crises**, most of which stemmed from Musk’s approach and broader platform issues[1][2][4]."
Delta Air Lines Shares Jump Despite Travel Slowdown - The Wall Street Journal,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPYUlTRUJJbV9kaTVselM2U2Y4RlR6ZFF3bF9YRGlZUzZ4MV8zVzg3TGVBZUlXRXg1RzItdmdqN1BLaGZfZTBxbVB6RUEwbXZmVGJYYlRFaGJvVmc4cDBmOUpiRHVSUFpaaXctWC00dXppYjRHa3VEam9ZRWZEX1lLRmt6NzhnQQ?oc=5,"Delta Air Lines shares rose significantly, despite broader concerns about a slowdown in travel demand. On July 10, 2025, Delta’s stock closed at **$56.78**, marking a jump of about **12%** for the day[3]. This surge follows the airline’s release of an improved outlook for 2025, which reassured investors and outweighed worries about a general cooling in travel demand[2].

The sharp rise comes as investors responded positively to Delta’s updated guidance, which evidently signaled stronger financial performance or cost controls than previously expected, even as the travel sector faces headwinds. Market sentiment toward Delta turned bullish on this revised outlook, and the stock's year-to-date and recent performance outpaced earlier forecasts, which had projected more modest gains for the year[5][1].

In summary, Delta’s stock jumped due to investor optimism fueled by its improved outlook for 2025, bucking the industry trend of moderating demand and showing investor confidence in Delta’s business strategy and ability to navigate sector challenges[2][3]."

- The **AirPods Pro 2** are now available for **$149**, which is $100 off their usual price and marks their lowest price ever in new condition. This beats previous all-time lows, including Black Friday deals last year[1][3][4].
- The **AirPods 4** have also hit record lows, now selling for **$89** (without ANC) and **$119** (with Active Noise Cancellation), both of which are new all-time lows[1][3][4].
- These deals are available at major outlets like Walmart and Amazon, with prices being matched between the two[1][4].
- All three major AirPods models discounted (AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Max) were released in 2024 and feature **USB-C charging**, improved battery life, and better sound quality compared to previous generations[2].

However, there is a notable difference: the **iPhone 17 Air’s version of the A19 Pro will have a 5-core GPU** instead of the Pro models’ 6-core GPU[1][3][4]. This means the **graphics performance will be weaker on the Air model** compared to the full-featured Pro phones.

Key details:
- **iPhone 17 Air**: A19 Pro chip, **5-core GPU**, 12GB RAM[1][3][4].
- **iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max**: A19 Pro chip, **6-core GPU**, 12GB RAM[1][3][4].
- **iPhone 17 (standard)**: Base A19 chip, 8GB RAM, lower overall performance[1][3].

The decision to use a **“binned” A19 Pro chip** (a version with one disabled GPU core) in the Air model allows Apple to offer a high-end processor but distinguish the Air from the Pro models by slightly reducing its graphics capabilities[3][4]. For most consumers, the difference in graphics performance is expected to be minor in real-world use, but power users and gamers may notice some impact[2]. The rest of the specs, such as **RAM (12GB)**, are expected to match the Pro lineup, making the Air model notably more “Pro” than prior non-Pro offerings[1][2][4]."

This new browser is reportedly scheduled for release in the coming weeks.

Key aspects of OpenAI's upcoming browser include:

- **AI-Driven User Experience:** The browser aims to transform traditional web browsing by leveraging artificial intelligence, enabling a more conversational and interactive experience. It will reportedly keep certain user interactions within a ChatGPT-like native chat interface, rather than requiring users to navigate out to external websites[1][2][3].

- **Competitive Target:** By entering the browser market, OpenAI is positioning itself against Google Chrome, which currently dominates the sector and serves as a critical foundation for Alphabet’s advertising business[2][3][5].

- **User Data Access:** One of the motivators for OpenAI's move is to gain more direct access to user data. Currently, Chrome’s ability to collect user information underpins Google's ad targeting and revenue. The new OpenAI browser could allow OpenAI to better understand user needs and habits, giving it a strategic advantage[2][3][5].

- **Potential Impact:** OpenAI’s large user base—reportedly 400 to 500 million weekly active ChatGPT users—could significantly challenge Chrome's market share if even a portion migrate to the new browser[2][3][5].

- **Integration of Operator:** The browser is expected to integrate “Operator,” OpenAI’s web-browsing AI agent, as a core feature, offering advanced navigation and information retrieval capabilities[1].

This development follows the recent launch of Perplexity’s AI-powered browser, Comet, which also aims to innovate web browsing using artificial intelligence[1][4]. OpenAI's move is part of a broader strategy to embed its technology across different aspects of users' digital lives, potentially shaking up the balance of power in the browser and online advertising markets[3][5]."

This prototype was recently auctioned at Sotheby’s in Paris during Couture Fashion Week, fetching a record-breaking **$10 million**, making it the most expensive handbag ever sold at auction[2][3][4].

The **Birkin bag** itself was conceived after a chance 1981 meeting between Jane Birkin and Hermès executive Jean-Louis Dumas on an Air France flight. Birkin famously sketched her ideal bag on an airplane sick bag, leading Dumas to create a roomy, practical handbag specifically for her[4]. The result was the first Birkin bag, a hybrid of the Birkin 35 and 40, adorned with Birkin’s initials ""J.B."" on the flap and personalized elements like a nail clipper and stickers for humanitarian organizations[3].

Since its introduction in 1984, the Birkin bag has evolved into a **symbol of wealth, exclusivity, and pop culture influence**, with notoriously high prices, long waiting lists, and a reputation as a Veblen good—an item whose value rises with its price[1][2]. The bags are handmade in limited quantities, often creating artificial scarcity and fueling a thriving resale market[1]. Standard Birkins retail for at least $11,400, but special editions and unique history can drive prices into the millions[1][3].

The $10 million sale of Jane Birkin’s bag underscores its unique legacy—not just as a luxury accessory, but as a storied artifact tied to fashion history and cultural mythology[2][3][4]."

The show stars **Megan Stalter as Jessica**, a New Yorker who relocates to London following a disastrous breakup and soon becomes entangled with **Felix** (played by Will Sharpe), an indie musician who upends typical romantic hero expectations[1][3]. 

The critical reception, as highlighted in The Washington Post headline, focuses on how Dunham both **honors and deconstructs** the classic rom-com formula. ""Too Much"" deliberately stays within the traditional structure of romantic comedies—celebrating their conventions rather than trying to subvert or judge them, which, paradoxically, becomes the show's way of distinguishing itself. The series blends **drama and comedy**, digging into the messy, self-sabotaging behaviors of its leads while maintaining enough levity and wit to keep the tone buoyant[2].

Key details include:
- A notable cast featuring Megan Stalter, Will Sharpe, and appearances by stars like Jessica Alba, Kit Harington, and Andrew Scott[1].
- A premise that explores **modern relationships and self-worth** through the lens of its flawed but compelling protagonists[2].
- Dunham's writing has been praised for sharp wit and insightful character work, reminiscent of her acclaimed earlier series ""Girls,"" but with a more intimate scope[2].

In summary, ""Too Much"" is recognized for **embracing the rom-com genre's conventions** while offering a fresh, contemporary take on love, loneliness, and emotional self-discovery in a chaotic modern world[2]."

Most mainstream draft coverage, such as MLB Pipeline's current **Top 150 Draft Prospects** and related lists, focuses on elite talents like Ethan Holliday, Seth Hernandez, Jamie Arnold, and Kade Anderson, who consistently appear at or near the top of rankings[1][3]. However, interest is also strong among fans and scouts in identifying **potential late-round steals, hidden gems, or breakout candidates** who might be overlooked because they fall outside the most publicized lists[1][5]. 

Features like the one in question often delve into:
- Standout players by state who might not have national recognition but are impressing locally or in college ball[4].
- College players with strong production but lacking premier tools, or high school athletes making late leaps in development[5].
- Prospects with unique backgrounds or paths, such as those excelling at smaller colleges or in less-scouted regions[4].

This type of reporting aims to build awareness for a wider pool of draft-eligible talent, broadening the conversation beyond the consensus top prospects and providing valuable context for teams, fans, and analysts interested in the deeper layers of the draft class. While the exact list of names from the New York Times article isn't present in your provided results, this approach is consistent with annual draft coverage trends and supplements the focus on headline prospects like those listed in the MLB's Top 150[1][5]."

**Key figures mentioned:**
- **Nikola Topić** and **Bronny James** are among the notable non-rookies generating attention this year. 
   - Bronny James, in particular, is playing in his second consecutive Summer League with the Los Angeles Lakers. Last season, after substantial media coverage, he spent time with the South Bay Lakers in the G League, averaging 18.6 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game, and is now looking to take a step forward in his development[2][3].
   - Nikola Topić, another young prospect, is also highlighted as a player to monitor, although specific details about his previous season's performance are not included in the search results.

**Context of the Summer League:**
- The Summer League serves as a platform for young NBA talent—including recent draft picks, “sophomores,” and G League standouts—to further develop their games and compete for NBA roster spots[2]. 
- Players like Bronny James are being watched to see if they can transition from promising young athletes to consistent contributors at the NBA level[3][4].

Everything Laurent Mekies must do as Christian Horner’s Red Bull successor - Motorsport.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPY05iZTYyVlAzVkw2MHY4dkNhbU9CZ0FKSUJMQ2lPNWdqTHRtNjZhVXZEakFLM2ZqTVJJeW0tV2E5cHdKMHItX2xJcHFBN0F4Rkoxa0lHOEVjU3RycklVWmhJei1xOURxTE5mLXZNUm5zaEZmcHpMY2FHekx2NnIzR1o4dE94ZVRnOXByYVVfMXlCb1U4bDBBVTVkQQ?oc=5,"Laurent Mekies has taken over as CEO and head of Red Bull Racing, succeeding Christian Horner after Horner’s immediate and high-profile exit following more than 20 years in charge[3][5]. Mekies, who previously led the Racing Bulls team (formerly AlphaTauri), faces an exceptionally challenging task as he steps into one of the most scrutinized roles in motorsport[2][3].

**Key issues Mekies must address include:**

- **Restoring Team Performance:** Red Bull is enduring a difficult period, currently sitting fourth in the Constructors’ Championship after a poor first half of the 2025 season and internal turmoil[2][5]. Reinvigorating technical, operational, and race-day performance will be a top priority.
- **Managing Star Talent:** Rumors swirl around Max Verstappen’s future, including possible moves to Mercedes for 2026[2][4]. Mekies must stabilize the relationship with Verstappen—offering reassurance and potentially more influence—to persuade the star driver to stay, as his camp now has increased leverage within the team[4].
- **Building Power Unit Capabilities:** Red Bull is developing its own power unit in partnership with Ford, a complex multi-year project critical for the 2026 engine regulations. Overseeing a seamless and competitive transition is essential to the team’s future[2].
- **Infrastructure and Personnel:** Major investments, such as a new wind tunnel, are in progress. Mekies must oversee these projects while also halting the exodus of key employees and building team morale[2].
- **Adapting to New Management Structure:** Since Dietrich Mateschitz’s death, Red Bull has shifted from a singular vision to a more committee-driven leadership structure[1]. Mekies must navigate this new environment, working closely with Red Bull's senior management, including Oliver Mintzlaff, to set a direction aligned with the organization’s current culture and goals[1][2].
- **Establishing Authority and Vision:** Taking over from an iconic and long-standing leader like Horner, Mekies must quickly build trust, establish his own leadership style, and articulate a clear vision for Red Bull’s next era[2][3].

Mekies’ background—as an engineer, FIA safety director, and experienced leader across various F1 organizations—positions him well for these tasks, but the scale of change and scrutiny means success will depend on immediate results and long-term strategic clarity[2]."
"Echoes from the Big Bang suggest Earth is trapped inside a giant cosmic void, scientists claim - Live Science",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOWWt0Tm92ZFJrV1pGYTNWSDc0SmhpVnkwbkVEMVhXTmtTRzZLLU03bnRjMFk4RzR3dlp1VXVVOTMzd2xpdHV1VDZlQUtfOWdYRFN6aDFxaksxdHBwLTJOeHlUWVZsa0htTDhVSUlKV3NjdnZKVTY0QTRFMVNXNjhQR21WQkY5eFVpM0hJU3dTQXY2YzI3azZXVFNCaGxDdVNRaVhNY0Vnajd1TmZMckhYcGdBX21JSnJXMXZBYjljaVJ0STVLQjBQdGpyVndMTE9WV2s0?oc=5,"The headline ""Echoes from the Big Bang suggest Earth is trapped inside a giant cosmic void, scientists claim"" refers to new research presented at the Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting in July 2025. According to this research, astronomers propose that **Earth and the Milky Way may be located within a massive cosmic void—an underdense region of space possibly spanning up to 2 billion light-years across**[1][3][5].

This idea is based on the analysis of **""sound waves"" created shortly after the Big Bang**, known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), as well as measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the afterglow of the Big Bang[3][5]. These ancient echoes serve as a ""standard ruler"" that allows astronomers to chart the universe's expansion history[3].

The motivation for this hypothesis is to address the persistent **""Hubble tension""**: a major disagreement between two different methods of measuring the universe’s expansion rate. Measurements based on the CMB (early universe observations) yield a lower rate, while measurements based on nearby galaxies show a faster expansion[1][5]. Placing the Milky Way within a vast cosmic void could explain why local measurements indicate a higher expansion rate—gravity would pull matter toward the denser regions outside the void, accelerating expansion inside it and making the local region appear to expand faster than the cosmic average[1][5].

This theory is still **controversial** and under investigation, but recent evidence from the so-called ""echoes from the Big Bang"" gives it new weight[1][3][5].

In summary:
- **Scientists claim Earth may be inside a giant cosmic void**[2][3][5].
- This void could **help explain the Hubble tension** by accounting for the difference in measured expansion rates[1][5].
- **Evidence comes from analysis of cosmic sound waves (baryon acoustic oscillations) and the cosmic microwave background**[3][5].
- The research was presented at a major scientific meeting in July 2025[1][3][5]."
Did you feel it?

Two more similarly short days are predicted on July 22 and August 5, 2025[1][3][4]. These changes in day length are imperceptible to humans but are significant for precision technologies such as atomic clocks, GPS, and satellite communications[1][2].

The primary reasons behind this phenomenon are:

- The **Moon’s current orbital position**, which, when farther from the equator, leads to reduced tidal drag and allows Earth to spin slightly faster[1][2][4].
- **Internal changes within Earth**, such as the slowing of the liquid core and mass redistribution due to melting ice caps and atmospheric shifts, also contribute to these small variations[1][2].

Timekeeping authorities are monitoring these changes closely, as they might eventually require a correction called a **negative leap second** to keep global time standards in sync[1][2].

While these shifts are fascinating and crucial for scientific measurements, they do not affect daily human life because the changes are incredibly small—measured in milliseconds[1][3][4]."
Things Are Suddenly Looking Up For NASA Science - NASA Watch,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPRDJ2dG1Ca3lMTmlPbVZIZ1VmOW9mdUtwcDBJb1c4Z0hmNXhieUxyNERucVdaYkkwU0h0Y3Y4cXNMMFQxUVdGMWpkeGxRQWw0LV9sSFZPdEJuQzFwSFlPaXdkaWZ0YWJDZEdJbGpzUHljeEs1dGhycTNWQzg2RGlOUXpfYnlUZw?oc=5,"The headline ""Things Are Suddenly Looking Up For NASA Science"" from NASA Watch refers to recent positive developments regarding **NASA's science funding prospects**. Specifically, this shift is tied to the actions in the U.S. Senate concerning NASA's budget for science programs.

Key factors behind the optimism include:

- At a recent Senate Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee markup, it was indicated that the Senate is **moving to restore or increase science spending for NASA**. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), when asked about the potential restoration of science funding in the scheduled NASA bill markup, replied, “The answer is yes”[2].
- This change comes amid concerns about NASA layoffs and fears that the U.S. might fall behind competitors like China in space leadership, sparking attention on the need to sustain investment in scientific research and retain research and development talent[2].
- The discussion is occurring alongside broader conversations on the fiscal year 2026 budget, with warnings that proposed cuts could halt missions and weaken U.S. leadership in space science, but the Senate's move signals a reversal or easing of those threats[4].

In summary, the headline captures a **reversal of previous budgetary pessimism**, with current Congressional actions suggesting that NASA’s science missions and workforce may receive much-needed support and funding[2][4]."
70 million-year-old dinosaur fossil discovered under Denver Museum of Nature & Science - The Denver Post,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQUWN5OFZVMERVRGNvcVFqU0U3X2dOZklJZEdSdXU4cEJUT2cyQWs1QlhBRU9wbWtrUW9PMUtPN1VGandOTUE5aGR1djFaSThmUjlxSkJsR3VJQnJabVRudWE3R2kyZWdqNm4tVGNBYkhLb2dDVXE4MWlvUEZVNmJqMk1xVjJ5OWdGNzBZ0gGQAUFVX3lxTE1mVUQzU2NyTUE0bjRUcllHSVpFYld1WmdUMU9TTGVoaDZDLUFYbE5rNV9zMl9qYnFPTVJPdjNLVXdsUDFpZzNWcmdFQ1RQMjJqODMwRm9yOVVrQ2xmNzRHZXY4b294VkFVaWF4Z3dzamxUMlZaUnFmdHVBN3V0OE5sY2NtOXZ1U3liMFgtVlQ0bA?oc=5,"A **70-million-year-old dinosaur fossil** was discovered directly beneath the Denver Museum of Nature & Science during a routine drilling project in the museum’s parking lot. This surprising find occurred in January when museum staff were conducting exploratory drilling as part of a feasibility study to switch the museum’s energy system from natural gas to geothermal energy. Scientists seized the opportunity to conduct geological research using the coring samples extracted from deep beneath the surface[1][3][4].

At a depth of **about 763 feet**, researchers encountered the fossil—the *oldest and deepest dinosaur bone ever found within Denver’s city limits*. The discovery is highly unusual due to both the circumstances and the depth of the find. According to Dr. James Hagadorn, curator of geology at the museum, “It’s basically like winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning on the same day,” emphasizing the rarity of such a discovery in a narrow drill core[4].

The fossil itself is **a partial vertebra belonging to a plant-eating dinosaur** that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period, closely related to genera like *Thescelosaurus* or *Edmontosaurus*. These dinosaurs roamed the region just before the mass extinction event that marked the end of the dinosaur era[1][4].

Museum leaders and scientists have called the discovery “nothing short of magical” and a significant window into Denver’s ancient ecosystem. The fossil is now on display at the museum’s “Discovering Teen Rex” exhibit[1]."
The UN warns millions will die by 2029 if US funding for HIV programs isn’t replaced - AP News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPeHZ5S3VPb1dpQXM1SGpITlJwcVZ2cUx3Y3hHTld0eWxyUUo1N3ZPS21rWTFZb1pfZWVDWmptbllrLUhWLWJVSDNsRFFFUzRyUW1qemtNRUcyN1Z3ekhESEdTQ3huOThoS3dKSF9ud0hNSDNOakNxaGJwSVZTUXVLc3NGbXpmV0g2M0wtU2JYZ1gzNExWMnRWbmhfN05Ydk9XaDRzVXBJeGhuQQ?oc=5,"The headline “The UN warns millions will die by 2029 if US funding for HIV programs isn’t replaced” refers to a new report from the United Nations AIDS agency (UNAIDS) raising alarm over the recent and abrupt withdrawal of U.S. funding for global HIV/AIDS initiatives. The report indicates that years of U.S.-led investment have been crucial in reducing AIDS-related deaths to their lowest numbers in over three decades, providing life-saving medication and support to vulnerable populations worldwide[1][2][4].

However, over the past six months, the **sudden loss of approximately $4 billion in U.S. funding**—a result of President Donald Trump ordering the suspension of all foreign aid and subsequent closure of the U.S. AID agency—has triggered what UN officials describe as a “systemic shock” to the global AIDS response[1][4]. According to UNAIDS, if this funding gap is not filled by alternate donors, **over 4 million additional AIDS-related deaths and 6 million new HIV infections could occur by 2029**[1][2][4][5].

The consequences of this funding loss are already being felt:
- **Supply chains have been destabilized**
- **Health facilities are closing**
- **Thousands of clinics are left without staff**
- **Prevention programs have been set back**
- **HIV testing and community activities have been disrupted or stopped**[1][2][4][5]

UNAIDS also warns that the withdrawal of U.S. funding could prompt other major donors to reconsider their contributions, potentially reversing decades of progress against AIDS globally. This risk is compounded by broader geopolitical instability, wars, and climate change—factors further threatening coordinated international health efforts[1][2][4].

In summary, the UN is warning of a severe **public health crisis** unless the funding shortfall caused by the U.S. decision is urgently addressed to sustain the global fight against HIV/AIDS[1][2][4][5]."
"U.S. measles cases hit 33-year high, CDC says - Axios",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE14SXN1ZGd6MF9FUENnZkJDQjZCS1FUQkZSaXRScnhMbURZZ2JERVRMdUg2UVk3bEVBSFdEelh1QjI0aV9MeGVQMkpaTVdBVXlhSlJqYzFESC1IeTBvOElzNVlwTjNaLWYwRUxWNWZGX050VGtleUNOVkMxLW9VcWs?oc=5,"**U.S. measles cases have reached a 33-year high**, with **1,288 confirmed infections** reported across 39 states as of July 8, 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)[1][3][4]. This marks the highest yearly total since 1992 and surpasses the previous record of 1,274 cases set in 2019, highlighting a significant resurgence since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000[1][3].

**Key details:**

- **Outbreaks:** There have been **27 outbreaks** this year, accounting for 88% of cases—far surpassing the 16 outbreaks reported in 2024[1][4].
- **Demographics:** 
  - 29% of cases were in children under 5 years old.
  - 36% were in children aged 5 to 19[1].
- **Vaccination status:** 
  - 92% of cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.
  - Only 4% had received one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and another 4% had received the recommended two doses[1][3][4].
- **Severity:** Three deaths have been reported, and 13% of cases required hospitalization[1][4].
- **Geographic spread:** Cases have been confirmed in nearly every region of the country, including states such as Texas, California, Florida, New York, and Illinois, among others[3].

**Background:**  
Public health experts attribute this surge to **declining vaccination rates**, especially among young children. MMR vaccine coverage among kindergartners has dropped below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity, making outbreaks more likely[1][2]. Areas with low immunization rates, such as parts of West Texas, have seen particularly large outbreaks this year[1][4].

The MMR vaccine remains highly effective at preventing measles, but the decrease in vaccination rates has created vulnerabilities, leading to a breakdown in the protective barrier that previously prevented widespread outbreaks[2][1].

In summary, the U.S. is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in over three decades due largely to falling vaccination rates, resulting in multiple outbreaks and preventable deaths[1][3][4]."
"Antidepressant Withdrawal Is a Major Public Health Issue, Experts Warn - ScienceAlert",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQRkpuZDFGeHNrenB5RWsyNTlWR2VSR0szaUtmWkRJQUNFeTVUc2d1dUxtY3UyOVpXbHBtNGpoTVVVTEdPdV9MZ2h5WXRFako4Zkc5TGdnbTBlU3ZTdzdnVk9xUjd5T0VBSVdYeF9nTHFiRWw4ZDAtenFlQmx0LTNpbWpYZURKNlpvd1V0bHNtTDlyeVJiVE5rRGR6NUUtRWs?oc=5,"The headline ""Antidepressant Withdrawal Is a Major Public Health Issue, Experts Warn"" highlights increasing concern among specialists regarding the impact of **antidepressant discontinuation symptoms** as a growing public health challenge[5][2]. Recent research has shown that when people stop taking antidepressant medications—especially abruptly—they can experience a range of withdrawal symptoms including dizziness, nausea, vertigo, and nervousness[3][1]. Dizziness is reported as the most prevalent symptom, and these effects are much more common compared to stopping a placebo[3].

A robust evidence base now indicates that **acute withdrawal phenomena** can occur after discontinuing antidepressants, and awareness of this issue has historically been low despite its significant relevance[1]. Reports suggest that a considerable number of patients discontinue medication without medical supervision, increasing their risk for withdrawal symptoms. In some health systems, questions about antidepressant withdrawal are among the most common inquiries to medical advice services[1].

Despite these symptoms, the clinical significance of withdrawal reactions is still debated. Recent meta-analyses suggest that, on average, the number of discontinuation symptoms after stopping antidepressants is below the threshold for what is considered a “clinically significant” discontinuation syndrome[3]. Importantly, mood worsening is not typically associated specifically with withdrawal, so depressive symptoms that appear after stopping medication are more likely to reflect a relapse of depression rather than withdrawal itself[3].

Experts generally recommend **tapering antidepressant doses gradually over more than four weeks** rather than stopping abruptly to minimize the risk and severity of withdrawal symptoms[1][4]. Patients are strongly advised to discontinue these medications only under medical supervision[4].

In summary, the headline addresses growing awareness and concern among healthcare professionals that **antidepressant withdrawal symptoms represent a substantial public health issue**, requiring greater patient education, clinical attention, and health system resources[5][1]."
"Nearly 1 in 3 teens have prediabetes, CDC finds, in ‘wake-up call’ - STAT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNRmllN296U1dfb21KejN3MjBnQnVRZGJYMFFlUVQyMVlqTE16TnBRQ2ZQTXBsWFFHcWpRdm1lOFU0RHZQcDNqMVBRSUdFaVFDelNjWnBFaDUyakVhcWk1eGtNMEhycFFkRng2SEhOZ2VQZnNkZ1QyYTFYOTQxNEF4ak81M1VhVEEzOFVYY3BEOUFhSm41cHMtTVBQSnB1MGtPWnZWRE9nREJmZ2JEODNGS2dSZ1B0S1pzSGw5NzU2TzM?oc=5,"**Nearly one in three U.S. adolescents aged 12 to 17—about 32.7% or an estimated 8.4 million teens—had prediabetes in 2023, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**[1][2][4][5]. This finding has been widely described as a “wake-up call” by public health officials and medical experts due to its implications for the future health of American youth[1][4].

**Prediabetes** is defined as having blood sugar levels that are elevated above normal but not high enough to warrant a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis[1][3][5]. It is considered a “critical warning sign,” as it increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke if left unaddressed[1][4]. Early-onset chronic conditions, such as those developing in adolescence, are associated with worse long-term health outcomes[4].

The CDC’s analysis was based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, using both self-reported diabetes diagnoses and laboratory tests of blood sugar (fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c)[4]. The rise in prediabetes has been linked in part to increasing obesity rates among teens, though not all with prediabetes will progress to diabetes[4].

**Risk factors for prediabetes** include:
- Being overweight
- Having a parent or sibling with Type 2 diabetes
- Low physical activity (less than three times a week)[1]

CDC officials and health experts emphasize that **lifestyle changes—such as healthy eating and increased physical activity—can help prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes**[1][4]. Weight management and regular exercise are key recommendations[1].

This trend has reversed years of improvement seen in adult diabetes rates, with new diagnoses among adults no longer declining[1]. The data points to an urgent need for public health interventions and increased awareness among families and communities[4][5]."
